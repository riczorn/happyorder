# happyorder
A node typescript server to communicate with an old xml backend; an Ionic app to use it.

# node server
Obviously in the node folder, this is written for node 6 to 9 and tested on both Windows and Linux.

The main feature is communicating with the backend of the HappyOrder/uniKas server, which can be either local or remote.

It can be configured for basic security through the file in the node/config folder.

# ionic client
This is in the HappyOrder folder, for legacy reasons.
Started with Ionic 3 / Angular 4, it is very basic.
Some weird choices were made to 
- speed up the app
- accomodate customer requests

The app is also published on https://happyorder.it/apk/ and the play store.
